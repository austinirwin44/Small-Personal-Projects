# Fine-Tuning DistilBert for Sentiment Analysis - HuggingFace Project
### Austin Irwin
## Description
In order to perform sentiment analysis on imdb film reviews, I fine-tuned the model distilbert-base-uncased. I utilized an existing dataset with several film reviews, the corresponding text to the review, and a sentiment label (positive or negative). Fine-tuning the model using this dataset, I was able to produce a model that could accurately classify roughly 90% of film reviews as either positive or negative.
